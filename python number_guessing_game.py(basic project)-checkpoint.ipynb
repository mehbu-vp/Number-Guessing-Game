    "The \"Number Guessing Game\" is a simple Python program where the computer selects a random number between 1 and 100, and the player needs to guess that number. The player continues to guess until they get the correct number. After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game also keeps track of the number of attempts the player has made. Once the player guesses the correct number, the program congratulates them and displays the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the player wants to play again, they can choose to do so. The game will generate a new random number for them to guess."
